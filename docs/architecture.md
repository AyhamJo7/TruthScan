# TruthScan Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for the TruthScan fake news detection system.

## Overview

TruthScan is designed as a modular system with clear separation of concerns. The architecture follows modern R best practices and is organized around the following key components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering
2. **Model Training**: Implements various machine learning models for classification
3. **Prediction**: Provides functionality for making predictions on new statements
4. **Web Scraping**: Collects additional features from search engines
5. **User Interface**: Provides an interactive Shiny application for users

## Component Details

### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing component is responsible for:

- Loading raw data from TSV files
- Cleaning and transforming the data
- Creating different label versions (binary, three-class, multi-class)
- Extracting features from text using TF-IDF and SVD
- Creating dummy variables for categorical features
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets

Key design decisions:
- Use of tidyverse for data manipulation
- Modular functions for different preprocessing steps
- Comprehensive logging for tracking preprocessing steps
- Support for different classification approaches

### Model Training

The model training component implements various machine learning models:

- Random Forest using ranger
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks using Keras/TensorFlow

Key design decisions:
- Use of tidymodels for a consistent modeling framework
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Model evaluation using multiple metrics
- Feature importance analysis
- Parallel processing for improved performance

### Prediction

The prediction component provides functionality for:

- Making predictions on new statements
- Calculating prediction confidence
- Explaining predictions using feature importance

Key design decisions:
- Consistent prediction interface across models
- Support for batch prediction
- Comprehensive prediction metadata

### Web Scraping

The web scraping component collects additional features:

- Search result counts from search engines
- Source domains of search results
- Titles of search results

Key design decisions:
- Polite web scraping with appropriate delays
- Error handling for network issues
- Parallel processing for improved performance
- Normalization of search result counts

### User Interface

The user interface component provides an interactive Shiny application:

- Statement analysis
- Batch processing
- Model performance visualization
- Prediction explanation

Key design decisions:
- Modern dashboard design using shinydashboard
- Interactive visualizations using plotly
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Clear presentation of results

## Data Flow

The data flow in TruthScan follows these steps:

1. Raw data is loaded and preprocessed
2. Preprocessed data is used to train models
3. Trained models are saved for later use
4. New statements are preprocessed in the same way as training data
5. Preprocessed statements are fed to the models for prediction
6. Predictions are presented to the user through the UI

## Design Patterns

TruthScan uses several design patterns:

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different types of models
- **Strategy Pattern**: For selecting different preprocessing and modeling strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: For updating UI components based on user actions
- **Facade Pattern**: For providing a simple interface to complex subsystems

## Error Handling

TruthScan implements comprehensive error handling:

- Input validation for user-provided statements
- Graceful handling of network errors during web scraping
- Logging of errors for debugging
- User-friendly error messages in the UI

## Performance Considerations

TruthScan is designed for performance:

- Parallel processing for computationally intensive tasks
- Caching of intermediate results
- Efficient data structures for large datasets
- Optimized text processing algorithms

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

- Integration with external fact-checking APIs
- Support for more languages
- Real-time monitoring of news sources
- Mobile application
- API for programmatic access

## Conclusion

The TruthScan architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and maintainable. By following modern R best practices and using a clear separation of concerns, the system can be easily enhanced and adapted to new requirements.
